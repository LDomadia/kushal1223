            <p class="description">In honor of the 150th Anniversry of <strong>Stevens Institute of Technology</strong>, we have created a game 
                that acknowledges the rich history of Stevens. This game will test your knowledge of our university, academics, and maybe a few 
                random topics that will surprise you!</p>
            <p class="description">The game is pretty simple! Head on over to the "Play" tab where you will see different classrooms 
                you can choose to escape from. You will be given 10 questions to answer. If you are able to prove your worth and answer 
                all the questions correctly, you will be able to escape the classroom!</p>
