            <p class="description">In honor of the 150th Anniversry of Stevens Institude of Technology, we can created a game that acknowledges 
                the rich history of Stevens. This game will test your knowledge of our university, academics, and maybe a few random topics 
                that will surprise you!</p>
            <p class="description">DIRECTIONS: The game is pretty simple! Head on over to the "Play" tab where you will see different classrooms 
                you can choose to escape from. You will be given 20 questions to answer. If you are able to prove your worth and answer 
                all the questions correctly, you will be able to escape the classroom! Your escape time will be recorded as you play. 
                Try to land a top spot on the leaderboard!</p>
